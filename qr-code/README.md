## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is the css design code snippet of the card of the qr-challenge. I had to do a little experiment with the box-shadow and border-radius.

```css
.card {
  max-width: 31.5rem;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 2rem;
  padding: 1.6rem;
  box-shadow: 0 0.1rem 1.4rem hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
  border-radius: 1.8rem;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```

### Continued development

I still have a lot to improve in box-shadow and flexbox.
I have been reading a lot of articles from MDN and W3 school on this topics.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This website helped me to any thing i had to look upon.
- [MDN flex-direction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand flex-direction. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
